# GestureRecognition

The field of HRI has made a tremendous advance based on computer vision technology and aids of high
technology optical devices such as 3D depth camera. In order to make robot technology more accessible
to the public, however, it is necessary to develop HRI system that can run on a more simple platform.

The source code shows a program that can solve such a problem. The suggested solution provides an algorithm that
allows detection of human gestures with a single-lens camera. The algorithm detects human gestures
through tracing the convex hull K-mean cluster of the image. It showed around 92% of success rate in
detecting the gestures.

You need to setup OpenCV library properly with regarding to your system and project settings to use this program.
